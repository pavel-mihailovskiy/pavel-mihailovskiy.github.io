# Developer's Note: This is a sample _config.yml file offered with
# jekyll-theme-prologue for your convenience. To use it, move it to your
# project's root directory. Please note that the following lines are
# NECESSARY for Prologue to work correctly:
#
# theme: jekyll-theme-prologue
# collections: [sections]
#
# They activate the theme and tell Jekyll to find your homepage content
# in /_sections. Note where "sections" starts with an underscore
# and where it doesn't. The social settings will make links to
# Twitter, etc., but only if you give the URL.
#
# Also, be sure to customize url and baseurl for your site.
#

#
# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  The main thing that I understand now, is that a good engineer should have the Architect, Coder, DevOps QA and PM skills. It's a really cool opportunity for the project. When the engineer has all that skills - he lives for each project, he can clean imaging each step of that. Sometimes, when working on a new feature, it's could be a situation, when Customer changes his mind about this particular feature - could be a pretty annoying situation for the project, and I guess only Full Stack could be really useful in this case, cause he can see the whole picture with the thinnest places and he is able to update the existing functionality with minor blood.
